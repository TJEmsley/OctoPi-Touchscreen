# OctoPi-Touchscreen
Connecting Adafruit 2.8 PiTFT to my Raspberry-Pi, optimized to run OctoPi.
This script monitors the buttons on the PiTFT resistive touch display.
The state of the button is recorded in btn#Memory so that we can toggle things on and off with a single switch.
You can assign scripts or actions to each button.
This example toggles the TFT backlight with button 3 and starts/stops OctoPiPanel with button 4
